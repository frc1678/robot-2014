//Pseudocode for robot
		//Type out in outline form in comments to insert code later
		//NB:Minimize air pressure for everything
				
		//Intake in the front and back of robot. Hold in ball until input signal 
		//then stop or slow depending on instance.
		//Based on button
		
		
		
		//Pickup (possibly seperate sequence for each side of robot) 
		//Roll in until input signal. Using pneumatic trigger
		
		//Shut off roller, but pneumatic stays up. Save air. Not a lot of time either
		
		
		//Run-into-wall skid using pneumatics, toggle/ish sequence
		
		
		//Shooting
		//Auto prime to fire. Fire moving CAM in one direction only
		
		//Sensor possibly to register degree of turn before a full revolution of the CAM
		
		//Fender shot with back intake down (maybe)
		
		//Range pneumatics for determining length of shot, possibly fingers up
		
		//Long shot with front intake down and range pneumatics in non-fender-shot-position
		
		
		//Infrared and ball sensors could be used. Magnetic sensor of CAM
